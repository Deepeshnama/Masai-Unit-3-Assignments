    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>
        Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter. It is
        a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.
    </p>

    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>

    <p>
        The <span style="background-color: yellow;" >periodic table</span> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical
        symbol,
        such as <dfn>Fe</dfn> for iron, <dfn>H</dfn> for hydrogen, and <dfn>O</dfn> for oxygen. Elements are classified
        into groups and periods based on their properties.
    </p>

    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>

    <p>
        Chemical reactions are represented using chemical equations. Here's an example of a chemical reaction:
    </p>
    <p>
        <var>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> = 2H<sub>2</sub>O</var>
    </p>
    <p>
        This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (<var>H<sub>2</sub></var>) and oxygen gas
        (<var>O<sub>2</sub></var>) to form water (<var>H<sub>2</sub>O</var>).
    </p>

    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>

    <p>
        <u>Stoichiometry</u> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing
        chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.
    </p>

    <p>
        <sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a
        molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.
    </p>

    <h5>Conclusion</h5>

    <p>
        Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe
        to the
        reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.
